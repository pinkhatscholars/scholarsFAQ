#Pink Hat FAQ

### ðŸŽ€ How will I recieve my award ?
```
 Hereâ€™s how it works:  

- **Choose Your Exam**  
  - You can pick any eligible cybersecurity certification exam (e.g., Security+ or Pentest+ or CYSA+) 
- **Receive Your Voucher**  
  - I will personally purchase a voucher code from CompTIA.  
  - This voucher acts like **prepaid credit** that covers the cost of the exam.  
- **Redeem Your Voucher**  
  - When you schedule your exam, enter the voucher code at checkout â€” no payment needed.  
- **Book on Your Schedule**  
  - Youâ€™ll have time to study and use the voucher before its expiration date (usually 12 months).  

ðŸ’¡ *Think of it as me buying you a ticket to take the test â€” you donâ€™t have to pay anything out of pocket.*
